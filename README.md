$ npm i redux redux-thunk redux-persist redux-logger --save

app > redux +
redux > actions > actions.js
redux > actions > taskAction.js
redux > reducers > index.js
redux > taskReducer > taskReducer.js
redux > store > store.js

- update App.js by mapDispacthToProps to call taskActions to perfrom API calls, as mentioned in code snippets/gist
- update App index.js by adding reducer and connect with store, as mentioned in code snippets/gist
